# DNA Data Storage Project

This project aims to develop a secure, adaptive DNA-based data storage system using compression, encryption, and machine learning for error correction.

## Features
- Adaptive encoding for text and image data
- Data compression to reduce storage volume
- AES encryption for data security
- Machine learning for error correction
- Real-time data retrieval via a web interface

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code for the project
- `docs/` - Documentation and project proposal
- `tests/` - Unit tests and test cases
